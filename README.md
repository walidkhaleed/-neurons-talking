# -neurons-talking
This project focuses on analyzing neural activity through extracellular recordings. It involves identifying spike times, characterizing neuron activity, and distinguishing spikes from different neurons in both simulated and real datasets. The aim is to decode brain activity and address challenges in noisy data analysis.
